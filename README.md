Unfortunately, not all users of this system are acclimated to using computers day in and day out. Therefore, all GUI interactions must be simple and intuitive with large controls and thorough explanations.

### Project Goals
* Develop a backend data storage system that can be easily shared/synced on a LAN. Files should be maintained at the client level.
* Develop a peer - peer network that syncs all data storage locations
* Create a SolidEdge BOM exporting tool that will export an atomic-level BOM for dissemination in the shop
* Develop a dataManager that communicates on the aforementioned network and maintains local storage
* Develop modularity via user roles
* Provide ample documentation to further any future program development and distribution
* Program should be low maintenance or virtually maintenance free


### To-Do List
The following list will be maintained and updated as new issues and developments arise
